This script prepares data for publication on [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/). The script transforms the raw data to a [Darwin Core Archive](https://www.gbif.org/darwin-core) that can be harvested by GBIF. It was developed for the [Biodiversa+ pilot on invasive alien species monitoring](https://www.biodiversa.eu/2024/02/02/pilot-on-invasive-alien-species-monitoring-first-year-report/) project.
